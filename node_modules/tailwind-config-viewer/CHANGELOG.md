### Changed

- Tailwind is now peer dependency. This change allows the resolving of the Tailwind config to use the same version of Tailwind as your project. Previously, if you project was using Tailwind 2.0, the config displayed in the config viewer would use the Config Viewers version of tailwind resulting in the wrong default values in some instances.
